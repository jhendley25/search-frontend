## notes
- make sure you `gem install sass`
- Backbone views and router and maybe model will (probably) not use es6 class syntax because of compatibility issues. see https://gist.github.com/StevenLangbroek/6bd28d8201839434b843 for a potential fix (es7) and https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3560 for the discussion
